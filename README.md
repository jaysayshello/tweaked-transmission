# Tweaked-Transmission

Eventually this will make using Transmission easier. The main thing of importance is allowing users to set a time in which to start a torrent using cronjobs within this tool.


# Current requriements
cronjob

# Setup
Must first create a cronjob via crontab -e, that points to a file named torrents.sh, the script will append to torrents.sh.
